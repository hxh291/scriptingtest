# scriptingtest

The first couple of links in our project were some definition terms. I read through those first before starting.

In #3, "What is Shell," I was provided a few commands to try in the terminal; date, cal, pwd, and ls. The cal command did not work in the git-bash terminal so I only tried the other three commands.

Once I downloaded the nano text editor for Windows, I used my git-bash terminal to create a task.sh script file. I added the date, pwd, and ls commands into the editor and saved it, made the file executable, and finally executed the new script.

In #9, I created the hello-world.sh script. I really just used the which bash command to create the file. Then I opened it up in my nano text editor. I made sure that the #!/bin/bash was on the first line. Then completed the script and saved it. Once I made the hello-world.sh executable, I executed the script.

#10 was the one that gave me the most issues. As of right now, I still have not gotten it to work properly. I was able to create the backup.sh script, but I was not able to get the provided code to work properly. I know my home directory is \c\Users\rudyc but I still was not able to get it to function. So, that first command that is executed in the instructional video did not work for me. I just decided to try out the next commands starting with the ls -l /tmp/myhome_directory.tar.gz command. Everything else in this step seemed to work fine. However, I did get certain errors later on in the project during executions.

On to #11, "Variables." I really did not have an issue with this one. I basically followed along with the video. I even went back and edited the backup.sh with the new tweaks. Of course, it did not give me the exact results because of the issue I had in #10.

#12 was the creation of file1.txt with the cat > command. Once I typed in the demo sentence, I pressed CTRL+D to return to the terminal commands. Then I typed cat < followed by file1.txt and my demo text printed out.

#13 through 17 were pretty much the same as "Variables." I followed the instructions and was able to modify the backup.sh script, but because of issues in #10, executing the script did not work out perfectly. I will continue to see if I can get it to work. If I am unable to, then I will only be able to pull in the .sh scripts that we created in this project.
